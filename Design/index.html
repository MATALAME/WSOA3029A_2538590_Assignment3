        <p> I chose the Poppins because I felt like it’s a great choice for my fruit-based website because of its modern, clean aesthetic and high 
            readability, making the website’s content accessible across devices. Its sans-serif font and it gives a fresh, contemporary feel, which
            fits perfectly with the health and lifestyle themes I'm promoting. The font has a neutral, friendly look that helps create an inviting 
            experience for users, encouraging healthy eating habits. Plus, with the di0erent weights, I can easily highlight key sections like fruit 
            benefits or subscription plans to bring to attention to important information.</p>
