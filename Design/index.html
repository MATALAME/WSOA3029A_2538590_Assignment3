        <h2> Fonts</h2>
        <p> I chose the Poppins because I felt like it’s a great choice for my fruit-based website because of its modern, clean aesthetic and high 
            readability, making the website’s content accessible across devices. Its sans-serif font and it gives a fresh, contemporary feel, which
            fits perfectly with the health and lifestyle themes I'm promoting. The font has a neutral, friendly look that helps create an inviting 
            experience for users, encouraging healthy eating habits. Plus, with the di0erent weights, I can easily highlight key sections like fruit 
            benefits or subscription plans to bring to attention to important information.</p>

    <section id = "Reflection">
        <h2> Reflection</h2>
        <p> I searched for many different APIs to use for my website and spent hours trying to understand what live APIs meant. I initially assumed that 'live' meant 
            APIs that updated daily, which led me to find fewer free online APIs, as many were restricted and only allowed limited data access. The lecturer clarified 
            what was meant by 'live' APIs and I eventually found a GitHub repository with a list of public APIs, where I discovered the one I wanted to use in the food 
            section, specifically focused on fruits. </p>
        <p> The API includes properties and characteristics of fruits, such as fat, protein, sugar, and more. I decided to create a fruit subscription website that 
            combines health with convenience. Drawing inspiration from the data-driven insights of the API, I aimed to build a platform that educates and also encourages 
            healthy living through fruit consumption. I realized I could tell a compelling story about the health benefits of different fruit groups. 
            My goal is to offer a seamless and enjoyable experience where users can access valuable information and engage with content, such as recipes, fitness 
            tips, and coaching making healthy choices simple, and accessible.</p>
    </section>

    <section id = "Resources"> 
        <h2> Resources</h2>
        <p> To achieve the clean, modern aesthetic I envisioned for the website, I spent time browsing royalty-free image websites, specifically searching for high quality 
            fruit images. Most of the images I selected were sourced from the Freepik website, which offered multiple collections of images that aligned with my design goals. 
            To further refine the look and ensure consistency with my branding, I edited the chosen images in Photoshop. Adjusting colours, enhancing details, and 
            overlaying custom text. For example, on the "UNLOCK" page, I added the headline "Explore the Health Benefits of Fruits!" to create a visually striking yet 
            informative element that invites users to dive deeper into the content. These edits helped to improve the overall presentation, ensuring the imagery was both engaging and 
            aligned with the website’s goal of promoting healthy living through fruit consumption. </p>

    <section id = "code"> 
        <h2> Code</h2>
        <p> For some of the functions and styling on the website, I reused code from a previous assignment to manage my time. There were crucial elements, such as the navigation bar, 
            that I wanted to reuse. I also added new features, like a slight resize effect when hovering over certain cards, dynamically added buttons, and a background color change when 
            hovering over a button. </p>

    <section id = "challenges"> 
        <h2> Challenges</h2>
        <p> The first challenge I faced was finding a suitable API. I had to look through numerous APIs, each with different pricing, and many of them lacked clear and straightforward 
            documentation. This made the selection process more time-consuming. Another issue was with the navigation bar. I reused code from a previous project, but the script failed 
            to work because the file path was too long, it was buried within multiple folders, causing the ‘root’ directory issue. Additionally, working with D3.js presented some difficulties. 
            Although the syntax was a bit complex to grasp initially, the examples we covered in class made it easier to implement certain features.</p>
