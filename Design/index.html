        <h2> Colour Palette</h2>
        <img src = "../Images/ColourPalette.jpg" alt = "Colour Palette Image">
        <ul> <li> #EFF0ED (Light Greyish White) – The original color which was #FFFFFF (pure white), was changed because the high contrast between black and white felt too harsh. 
            I chose a softer, more neutral shade to create a gentler, more comfortable visual experience. This new color maintains readability while being easier on the eyes, 
            enhancing the overall user experience by reducing visual strain. The colour is used for the background, as it is soft and neutral, creating a clean, minimalistic look, 
            allowing the vibrant fruit images and colours of the fruit plans to stand out.</li> 
            <li> #CDC6BA (Light Orange) – This colour was chosen to represent the ‘Citrus’ fruit plan because it resembles the natural colours of fruits like oranges and grapefruits. 
            Light orange is also often associated with warmth, positivity, and vitality, which aligns with the benefits of citrus fruits as they are known for boosting energy and 
            immune health. The warm orange tone creates a friendly and inviting feel, which encourages engagement and interest in the Citrus plan. It also helps maintain visual 
            consistency, reinforcing the website's overall theme of health and freshness.</li>
            <li> #FADD1C (Vibrant Yellow) – yellow is commonly associated with citrus fruits and some tropical fruits which helps users visually connect the colour with the diet plans 
            that feature these fruits. Yellow is also linked to feelings of happiness, optimism, and vitality which are qualities that resonate with a healthy lifestyle and align 
            with the positive impact these diet plans aim to provide.</li>
            <li> #3D7341 (Green) – Green is commonly associated with nature and health wellness, making it appropriate for a brand centered on fruit diet plans. The colour is also 
            popular for symbolizing freshness, growth, and sustainability, which aligns with the website’s aim of promoting a natural, healthy lifestyle. By using this colour the 
            website conveys a health-conscious image, appealing to customers who prioritize wellness and health. Additionally, green is known to evoke feelings of trust and stability, 
            which can help reassure users that the diet plans are reliable and beneficial for their health.</li>
            <li> #000000 (Black) – I chose black for the text as it provides effective readability. Black provides a strong contrast against lighter backgrounds, which is essential 
            for visual clarity. This contrast enhances legibility, making it easier for users to read and comprehend the information presented</li>
            <li> #AE453B (Light Red) – This colour effectively represents the berry fruit plan, as it closely resembles the vibrant hues of strawberries and raspberries, reinforcing 
            the fruit-centred theme of the website. It not only evokes feelings of freshness and health, enticing visitors to explore the plan, but also creates a cohesive visual 
            identity throughout the site by ensuring that all fruit plans are distinctly represented.</li>
            <li> #A73B3F (Maroon) – Its darker shade creates a strong contrast against lighter elements of the palette, improving readability and guiding users' attention to important 
            information. By using Maroon, the theme of health and vitality is reinforced, enticing visitors to consider the diverse benefits of the fruit plans. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Fonts</h2>
        <img src = "../Images/Fonts.jpg" alt = "Fonts Image">
        <p> 1. Poppins is a sans-serif typeface that is known for its clean lines and modern look. It includes various weights which allow for a clear hierarchy, 
            making it ideal for headings in bold and normal text for paragraphs. This versatility ensures that users can easily navigate through the content, enhancing 
            their overall experience. It also has rounded edges which gives it a friendly and approachable feel, aligning well with the inviting nature of the fruit-themed 
            website. This tone encourages visitors to engage with the content and feel comfortable exploring the fruit plan subscriptions. Additionally, it also has a has 
            a contemporary design that resonates with a health-conscious audience, reinforcing the idea of fresh and trendy diet options. </p>
        
        <p> 2. Montserrat is also a sans-serif style, and it offers a nice contrast to Poppins. It’s been used for the footer which distinguishes the footer as 
            different while maintaining visual harmony throughout the site. This differentiation helps users easily identify the footer as a separate informational section. 
            Montserrat is designed for readability and works well in smaller sizes, making it a good choice for the footer text where information like contact details and 
            copyright notices are. Its professional appearance also aids the credibility to the brand.</p>

    <section id = "branding">
        <h2> Branding </h2>
        <img src = "../Images/Branding.jpg" alt = "Logo and Slogan">
        <p> The website is centered around fruits, making them the primary focus and goal. I decided to name the commercial website “Fruits.Co", short for "Fruits Company," 
            to emphasize its identity as a dedicated fruit business. The logo is a lemon icon that reinforces the fruit theme, creating a strong, memorable brand identity. To 
            maintain this consistency, the website features multiple fruit images, visually aligning with its purpose and enhancing the theme’s cohesiveness.</p>
        
        <p> Adding to the brand identity, the slogan "Fuel your day the fruity way" highlights the company’s mission to promote a fruit-filled lifestyle. The color palette, 
            inspired by a variety of fruits such as berries, tropical fruits, and citrus, complements this theme, creating an inviting, fresh aesthetic.</p>

        <p> To build credibility, custom logos I created on Canva represent partner companies supporting the business, creating a sense of credibility.  Additionally, a 
            testimonial from the CEO is included, further establishing trustworthiness and offering a personal touch to the business.</p>

        <p> To enhance the business's credibility, I’ve included logos of trusted payment options Apple Pay, VISA, and PayPal on the checkout page. This reassures users of 
            the secure and reliable payment methods available, creating confidence in the transaction process.</p>

    <section id = "nav-Bar">
        <h2> Navigation Setup </h2>
        <img src = "../Images/NavBar.png" alt = "Nav Bar Screeshot">
        <p> To enhance user navigation, the current page in the navigation bar is displayed in bold green text, making it easy for users to identify their location on the site. 
            The navigation bar includes links to all accessible pages, providing a clear structure for seamless browsing. Additionally, when users hover over each option, the cursor 
            changes to a pointer, clearly indicating that the items are clickable and enhancing the overall interactivity of the site. There is also sufficient spacing between the navigation 
            options to ensure good readability and to avoid overlapping, making it easy for users to distinguish and select each option comfortably.</p>
    </section>

    <section id = "interactive-elements">
        <h2> Interactive Elements </h2>
        <img src = "../Images/Buttons.jpg" alt = "Types of buttons">
        <img src = "../Images/Hover.jpg" alt = "Button Hover Image">
        <p> To enhance interactivity, the buttons feature a hover effect that changes their color, providing immediate visual feedback and indicating they’re clickable. I chose rounded-edge buttons 
            to create a softer, more approachable look, making the design feel modern and friendly. This rounded style reduces visual harshness and encourages user engagement. For certain actions, 
            like 'Subscribe,' I opted for slightly less rounded buttons to balance approachability with a professional, structured appearance. This design conveys both friendliness and precision, 
            which is especially valuable for actions involving transactions, where it’s important to establish a sense of both warmth and reliability. </p>
