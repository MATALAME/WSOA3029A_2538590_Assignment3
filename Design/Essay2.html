        <h2> Critical Reflection Essay</h2>
        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        <p> The process of creating this website was quite enjoyable and allowed me to explore a new category of websites beyond portfolio websites. I learned a lot about 
            commercial websites such as the need of understanding the user you are creating for and understanding that what I consider as effective may not be effective for 
            the potential user. These insights highlighted the importance of research and being a designer that seeks external feedback and critique from others and not to 
            rely only on my opinions.</p>

        <h3> The global economics and artistic implications</h3>
        <p> To develop the website, I used standard coding languages, namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are globally recognized. I focused on creating a strong semantic 
            markup to ensure the website is effectively accessible to the browser. I used CSS to style the website, ensuring the design aligned with the theme through clear layouts, 
            hover effects, and other elements to bring my design choices to life, making the fruit-based website more appealing to the target audience. CSS has helped me create a pleasant 
            user experience with animations, colours, and styled content. JavaScript handled the website’s functionality, enabling user engagement with the content without barriers. 
            For example, I used it to create a "back to top" button, so users don’t have to scroll all the way up, which could lead to frustration. I also used JavaScript with the D3.js 
            library, which played a crucial role by allowing me to present large datasets in a simplified, effective manner. This tool helped me convey meaning in the data visualizations 
            through colour and interface elements. While it was challenging at first to grasp the library and the syntax needed for effective visual representations, I learned from my mistakes 
            and explored the many design options D3 provided, such as selecting specific data from the API and focusing on central data points. Unfortunately, there were features I couldn’t 
            implement due to time management.
        </p>

        <h3> UI/UX designs (Meaning making) </h3>
        <p> The website focuses on promoting fruits and healthy eating, specifically targeted at users who are interested in improving their dietary habits for a healthier lifestyle. Understanding 
            this health-conscious audience has guided my UI/UX decisions, ensuring the design is both engaging and user-friendly to support their goals.</p>

        <p> The meaningful choices I’ve made include colour, hierarchy and interface elements. Regarding colour, the data visualizations use colour to create meaning. The saturation of the colour 
            represents interval values of the data, the lighter the colour the smaller the value and the darker the colour the larger the value. This helps users understand and interpret the data 
            aided by visual elements. </p>

        <p> With regards to the interface elements on the website, users are presented with multiple options such as input controls. The website has input controls such as text fields, filter buttons 
            and toggles. These allow users to enter data or make selections; these empower users to contribute their data, preferences, and choices, making them active participants in the experience, 
            ultimately enhancing the user experience. </p>

        <p> Regarding the data visualizations users have informational components such as tooltips and legends. These components allow users to understand big data in simplified ways as the tooltips 
            offer specific information regarding specific parts of the data. This allows users to interpret the large data in smaller sections which ultimately help them understand the broader meaning 
            of the data. In this case for the first data visualizations (the API from assignment 3), users were able to see nutritional stats about specific fruits such as calories, carbohydrates and protein. 
            Another component present is input controls such as the dropdown menu which helps users personalize their choice of the data they would like to see, and this selection helps users engage with specific data. </p>

        <p> Another way is through interaction of the interface elements. The buttons have hovering effects that change colour providing immediate feedback, enhancing the interactive experience. By visually distinguishing 
            buttons on hover, this indicates an action can be performed, guiding users intuitively. The hover effect not only enhances usability but also creates an association of interaction, reinforcing that these elements 
            are clickable and encouraging exploration for the user. </p>

        <h3>The role of interactivity</h3>

        <p> Interactivity plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience(UX) and shaping how users interpret the data on the website. For instance, the website provides users with a variety of interactive experiences. 
            For instance, the form fields provide feedback when users enter incorrect information or a required field. This feedback is essential as it guides users through the input process, helping them feel guided and informed; 
            potentially reducing their frustration. By providing these messages, users can adjust their entries which creates a more seamless and user-friendly experience by reducing errors and guiding users through each step. 
            Another instance is the diet plan options, the website offers users a choice between three fruit subscription plans which are accessible through interactive buttons. This selection process feels tailored, giving users 
            a sense of agency as they choose the plan that best fits their preferences. This personalized interactivity makes users feel involved in forming their experience, developing a feeling of control and customization. 
            The navigation menu is another interactive element on the website that allows users to easily access different pages. By allowing users to select specific content the wish to view , the navigation menu ensures users 
            can reach their desired information without any unnecessary obstacles, this makes the website more intuitive and user-friendly. </p>
        
        <p> Regarding data interpretation, interactive elements such as hover tooltips and filter buttons encourage the user to explore the website more deeply and also offer personalized experiences as they are able to focus on 
            content based on their need. For instance the hover tooltips offer users with more details on specific data elements, allowing them to explore large information in a simplified and condensed way leading to the user 
            not feeling overwhelmed. The filter buttons allow users to toggle the visibility of specific types of data, providing an additional way for personalization. Users can select certain data to display while excluding 
            others, enabling them to concentrate on their specific interests. This targeted approach simplifies the data interpretation, making it easier for users to engage with the information that matters most to them. 
            Additionally, the interactivity of these data visualizations enhances the user experience by providing essential feedback. The feedback from the tooltips and filter buttons allow users to access information without 
            needing to recall every detail, helping improve their understanding and the overall interaction with the data as it is presented to them through their interactions. </p>
        
        <h3> Challenges and solutions  </h3>

        <p> One of the biggest challenges I encountered during the development process was handling API data. For Assignment 3, I initially found an API that aligned perfectly with my website’s theme of fruits and healthy living, 
            as it provided details about various fruits, including their families and nutritional information. However, a week later, the API became unavailable, showing a “temporarily unavailable” error. I hoped it would come back 
            online, but as the exam approached, the API was still down. This forced me to search for a replacement. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a similar API, so I explored alternatives related to health. Eventually, I found an 
            API focused on Covid-19 and I used that information to highlight how fruits could help people by boosting their immune health. Switching to this new API added pressure, as I had to redo my data visualizations, creating 
            a total of five, which felt overwhelming. To manage time, I reused some elements from my previous code, like tooltips and legends, to complete the visualizations on time.</p>

        <p> Another challenge involved making the data visualizations responsive across different screen sizes. Ensuring that they were as accessible on smaller screens as they are on larger ones was difficult, as users often needed 
            to scroll to view the full visualizations. I attempted to fix this using media queries, but the results were not as effective as I’d hoped, leading to a less effective user experience. Additionally, there were new programming 
            concepts I wasn’t familiar with, which led to a lot of exploration on sites like MDN Web Docs and Stack Overflow, as well as asking a few classmates for help. This process sometimes caused delays, as I would move on to another 
            part of the website if I couldn’t figure out how to make a particular part of code work. However, eventually making the code work helped me understand the concepts better.</p>

        <p> The final issue was related to image loading times. The file sizes of the images were causing slow page loads, which negatively impacted user experience. I fixed this by compressing the images using online tools like IMG2Go and 
            TINYPNG, which helped reduce file sizes from around 5MB to as low as 900KB. This significantly improved loading times, enhancing the overall performance and user experience on my site.</p>

        <h3> Professional practices in international web/app development</h3>

        <p> The website aligns with the professional practices by prioritizing user experience through strong focus on the needs and preferences of the target audience. This is achieved by organizing content clearly and making essential 
            information easy to access, helping users make informed decisions. This transparency aligns with a user-centred design by prioritizing the user's need for relevant, accessible information, which enhances trust and user satisfaction. </p>

        <p> According to Fernando Almeida, responsive design offers several key advantages. First, it greatly enhances user experience by providing a seamless interface across all devices, allowing users to navigate and interact comfortably. Second, 
            it boosts accessibility by ensuring that all users, regardless of the device they use, can access content easily, broadening the reach to a more diverse audience (Almeida, 2017). Different regions have different device preferences, so 
            offering responsive designs for various screen sizes, orientations and resolutions is crucial as this helps consider many potential users and offer a sense of inclusion as more people are able to access the website.</p>

        <p> Another professional practice is the prioritization of the Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Aziz Barbar explains that on-page SEO involves optimizing individual web pages to help search engines understand their content. This approach 
            enhances the page structure to be accessible and useful for both search engines and users. Effective on-page SEO enables search engines to read, analyze, and index content efficiently, providing users with more relevant search results 
            (Barbar, 2019). This highlighted to me that key elements influencing on-page SEO include the page title, headers, meta descriptions, keywords, ALT tags, and file compression. Together, these factors significantly improve a website's usability 
            and search engine visibility. My website uses keywords within titles, headings, meta descriptions such as “Diet plans”, “Pricing” and etc. This helps search engines understand the focus and content of each of the fruit-based pages. Another way 
            of achieving a good SEO is my optimization of images through using Alt text to not only improve accessibility but also help search engines index these images, and also decreasing image file sizes to ensure faster load times and enhance the 
            overall performance of the website. </p>

        <p> Lastly, the website offers a sense of security and protection. When the password is filled in it uses ‘password masking’. The password is displayed as dots instead of plain text. This prevents accidental exposure of the password as others won’t 
            be able to see the user’s password. This also builds trust for users as they expect sensitive information to be hidden by default, creating trust between the user and website. However I could have improved this element by including an interactive 
            button that allows the user to toggle the visibility of the password, in case users would like to make adjustments to the password. </p>

        <p> In conclusion, developing this website was a valuable experience that helped me learn the importance of creating a user-focused, functional, and visually appealing commercial websites. I gained insights about understanding the target audience, 
            emphasizing accessibility, and balancing design with functionality to enhance user engagement. The challenges I faced such as the API unavailability and responsive design taught me how to adapt and improve my problem-solving skills. This project 
            also highlighted the importance of good practices in web development, such as responsive design, SEO, and security features. Overall, the skills and lessons I learnt from this project will be beneficial in my future work as a designer and web developer.</p>
