        <p> Yes, fruits play a key role in weight management, but they also offer benefits in other areas. For example, in the face of widespread diseases like COVID-19, 
            many have successfully recovered, and fruits can contribute to this recovery. Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, fruits help strengthen the immune system, 
            supporting your body in fighting off illnesses.
